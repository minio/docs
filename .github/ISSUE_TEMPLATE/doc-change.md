Opening a new issue to document a new feature/change.

The reference PR is in the title, kindly make sure that the PR is 
approved and merged first.

If the feature/change is not yet merged to latest stable, leave the PR in the RFM state and merge/publish only when we have a new release of the related product.
Ping the PR owner if you have further questions about the documentation change.
