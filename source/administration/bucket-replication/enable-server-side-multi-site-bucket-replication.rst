The procedure on this page configures automatic server-side bucket replication between multiple MinIO deployments. Multi-Site Active-Active replication builds on the :ref:`minio-bucket-replication-serverside-twoway` procedure with additional considerations required to ensure predictable replication behavior across all sites.

- To configure replication between arbitrary S3-compatible services, use :mc:`mc mirror`.

- To configure one-way "active-active" replication between two MinIO deployments, see :ref:`minio-bucket-replication-serverside-twoway`.

- To configure one-way "active-passive" replication between MinIO deployments, see :ref:`minio-bucket-replication-serverside-oneway`.

Multi-Site Active-Active replication configurations can span multiple racks, datacenters, or geographic locations. Complexity of configuring and maintaining multi-site configurations generally increase with the number of sites and size of each site. Enterprises looking to implement multi-site replication should consider leveraging `MinIO SUBNET <https://min.io/pricing?ref=docs>`__ support to access the expertise, planning, and engineering resources required for addressing that use case.

   - Use the :mc:`mc replicate update` command to modify an existing replication rule.

   - Use the :mc:`mc replicate update` command with the :mc-cmd:`--state "disable" <mc replicate update --state>` flag to disable an existing replication rule.

   - Use the :mc:`mc replicate rm` command to remove an existing replication rule.

Requirements
------------

You must meet all of the basic requirements for bucket replication described in :ref:`Bucket Replication Requirements <minio-bucket-replication-requirements>`.

In addition, to create multi-site bucket replication set up, you must meet the following additional requirements:

Access to All Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have network access and log in credentials with correct permissions to all deployments to set up multi-site active-active bucket replication.

You can access the deployments by logging in to the :ref:`MinIO Console <minio-console>` for each deployment or by installing :mc:`mc` and using the command line.

If using the command line, use the :mc:`mc alias` command to create an alias for each MinIO deployment. 
Alias creation requires specifying an access key for a user on the deployment. 
This user **must** have permission to create and manage users and policies on the deployment. 

Specifically, ensure the user has *at minimum*:

- :policy-action:`admin:CreateUser`
- :policy-action:`admin:ListUsers`
- :policy-action:`admin:GetUser`
- :policy-action:`admin:CreatePolicy`
- :policy-action:`admin:GetPolicy`
- :policy-action:`admin:AttachUserOrGroupPolicy`


Considerations

.. dropdown:: Use Consistent Replication Settings
   :icon: fold-down

   MinIO supports customizing the replication configuration to enable or disable the following replication behaviors:

   - Replication of delete operations
   - Replication of delete markers
   - Replication of existing objects
   - Replication of metadata-only changes

   When configuring replication rules for a bucket, ensure that all MinIO deployments participating in multi-site replication use the *same* replication behaviors to ensure consistent and predictable synchronization of objects.

.. dropdown:: Replication of Existing Objects
   :icon: fold-down

   MinIO supports automatically replicating existing objects in a bucket.

   MinIO requires explicitly enabling replication of existing objects using the :mc-cmd:`mc replicate add --replicate` or :mc-cmd:`mc replicate update --replicate` and including the ``existing-objects`` replication feature flag. 
   This procedure includes the required flags for enabling replication of existing objects.

.. dropdown:: Replication of Delete Operations
   :icon: fold-down

   MinIO supports replicating delete operations onto the target bucket. 
   Specifically, MinIO can replicate versioning :s3-docs:`Delete Markers <versioning-workflows.html>` and the deletion of specific versioned objects:

   - For delete operations on an object, MinIO replication also creates the delete marker on the target bucket.

   - For delete operations on versions of an object, MinIO replication also deletes those versions on the target bucket.

   MinIO requires explicitly enabling replication of delete operations using the :mc-cmd:`mc replicate add --replicate` or :mc-cmd:`mc replicate update --replicate`. 
   This procedure includes the required flags for enabling replication of delete operations and delete markers.

   MinIO does *not* replicate delete operations resulting from the application of :ref:`lifecycle management expiration rules <minio-lifecycle-management-expiration>`. 
   Configure matching expiration rules for the bucket on all replication sites to ensure consistent application of object expiration.

Procedure 
---------

This procedure requires repeating steps for each MinIO deployment participating in the multi-site replication configuration. Depending on the number of deployments, this procedure may require significant time and care in implementation. MinIO recommends reading through the procedure *before* attempting to implement the documented steps.

.. include:: /includes/common/bucket-replication.rst
   :start-after: start-create-bucket-replication-rule-console-desc
   :end-before: end-create-bucket-replication-rule-console-desc

Repeat the above steps to create a rule from this deployment to each of the other target deployments.

Then, repeat the above steps on each of the other deployments in the multi-site setup so that each deployment has a separate replication rule for all of the other deployments.

.. include:: /includes/common/bucket-replication.rst
   :start-after: start-validate-bucket-replication-console-desc
   :end-before: end-validate-bucket-replication-console-desc

Repeat this test on each deployment by copying a new unique file and checking that the file replicates to each of the other deployments.

.. _minio-bucket-replication-multi-site-minio-cli-procedure:

Configure Multi-Site Bucket Replication Using the Command Line (:mc:`mc`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure uses the placeholder ``ALIAS`` to reference the :ref:`alias <alias>` each MinIO deployment being configured for replication. Replace these values with the appropriate alias for each MinIO deployment.

This procedure assumes each alias corresponds to a user with the :ref:`necessary replication permissions <minio-bucket-replication-requirements>`.

.. _minio-bucket-replication-multi-site-minio-cli-create-remote-targets:

1) Create Replication Remote Targets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/common/bucket-replication.rst
   :start-after: start-create-replication-remote-targets-cli-desc
   :end-before: end-create-replication-remote-targets-cli-desc

Repeat these instructions for each remote MinIO deployment participating in the multi-site replication configuration. 

For example, a multi-site replication configuration consisting of three MinIO deployments ``minio1``, ``minio2``, and ``minio3`` requires repeating this step twice on each deployment. Specifically:

- The ``minio1`` deployment requires defining separate remote targets for ``minio2`` and for ``minio3``. 

- The ``minio2`` deployment requires defining separate remote targets for ``minio1`` and for ``minio3``.

- The ``minio3`` deployment requires defining separate remote targets for ``minio1`` and for ``minio2``.

More than three deployments requires additional remote targets on each deployment to create the required targets for each origin and destination bucket compination.

Record the ARN generated for each remote and note which origin-destination bucket combination you generated the ARN for.

2) Create New Bucket Replication Rules
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/common/bucket-replication.rst
   :start-after: start-create-bucket-replication-rule-cli-desc
   :end-before: end-create-bucket-replication-rule-cli-desc

Repeat these commands for each remote MinIO deployment participating in the multi-site replication configuration. 
For example, a multi-site replication configuration consisting of MinIO deployments ``minio1``, ``minio2``, and ``minio3`` would require repeating this step on each deployment for each remote. 
         
Specifically, in this scenario, perform this step twice on each deployment:

- On the ``minio1`` deployment, once for a rule for ``minio2`` and again for a separate rule for ``minio3``. 

- On the ``minio2`` deployment, once for a rule for ``minio1`` and again for a separate rule for ``minio3``.

- On the ``minio3`` deployment, once for a rule for ``minio1`` and again for a separate rule for ``minio2``.

3) Validate the Replication Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/common/bucket-replication.rst
   :start-after: start-validate-bucket-replication-cli-desc
   :end-before: end-validate-bucket-replication-cli-desc

Repeat this test on each deployment by copying a new unique file and checking that the file replicates to each of the other deployments.

You can also use :mc:`mc stat` to check the file to check the current :ref:`replication stage <minio-replication-process>` of the object.
