.. start-create-transition-rule-desc

Use the :mc-cmd:`mc ilm add` command to create a new transition rule
for the bucket. The following tabs contain examples for transitioning 
objects on a calendar date *or* after a number of calendar days.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Transition after Calendar Date

      .. code-block:: shell
         :class: copyable

         mc ilm add ALIAS/BUCKET \
         --storage-class TIERNAME \
         --transition-date DATE \
         --noncurrentversion-transition-date NONCURRENT_DAYS

      The example above specifies the following arguments:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 40 60
         :width: 100%

         * - Argument
           - Description

         * - :mc-cmd:`ALIAS <mc ilm add TARGET>`
           - Specify the :mc:`alias <mc alias>` of the MinIO deployment for which
             you are creating the lifecycle management rule.

         * - :mc-cmd:`BUCKET <mc ilm add TARGET>`
           - Specify the full path to the bucket for which you are
             creating the lifecycle management rule.

         * - :mc-cmd:`TIERNAME <mc ilm add storage-class>`
           - The remote storage tier to which MinIO transitions objects. 
             Specify the remote storage tier name created in the previous step.

         * - :mc-cmd:`DATE <mc ilm add transition-date>`
           - The ISO-8601-formatted calendar date after which MinIO marks an object
             as eligible for transition.

         * - :mc-cmd:`NONCURRENT_DAYS <mc ilm add noncurrentversion-transition-days>`
           - The number of calendar days after which MinIO marks a noncurrent
             object version as eligible for transition. Omit this value to
             ignore noncurrent object versions.

             This option has no effect on non-versioned buckets.

   .. tab-item:: Transition after Calendar Days

      .. code-block:: shell
         :class: copyable

         mc ilm add ALIAS/BUCKET \
         --storage-class TIERNAME \
         --transition-days DAYS \
         --noncurrentversion-transition-days NONCURRENT_DAYS

      The example above specifies the following arguments:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 40 60
         :width: 100%

         * - Argument
           - Description

         * - :mc-cmd:`ALIAS <mc ilm add TARGET>`
           - Specify the :mc:`alias <mc alias>` of the MinIO deployment for which
             you are creating the lifecycle management rule.

         * - :mc-cmd:`BUCKET <mc ilm add TARGET>`
           - Specify the full path to the bucket for which you are
             creating the lifecycle management rule.

         * - :mc-cmd:`TIERNAME <mc ilm add storage-class>`
           - The remote storage tier to which MinIO transitions objects. 
             Specify the remote storage tier name created in the previous step.

         * - :mc-cmd:`DAYS <mc ilm add transition-days>`
           - The number of calendar days after which MinIO marks an object as 
             eligible for transition. 

         * - :mc-cmd:`NONCURRENT_DAYS <mc ilm add noncurrentversion-transition-days>`
           - The number of calendar days after which MinIO marks a noncurrent
             object version as eligible for transition. Omit this value to
             ignore noncurrent object versions.

             This option has no effect on non-versioned buckets.

     
.. end-create-transition-rule-desc

.. start-create-transition-user-desc

This step creates users and policies on the MinIO deployment for supporting
lifecycle management operations. You can skip this step if the deployment
already has users with the necessary |permissions|.

The following example uses ``Alpha`` as a placeholder :mc:`alias <mc alias>` for
the MinIO deployment. Replace this value with the appropriate alias for the
MinIO deployment on which you are configuring lifecycle management rules.
Replace the password ``LongRandomSecretKey`` with a long, random, and secure
secret key as per your organizations best practices for password generation.

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   wget -O - https://docs.min.io/minio/baremetal/examples/LifecycleManagementAdmin.json | \
   mc admin policy add Alpha LifecycleAdminPolicy /dev/stdin
   mc admin user add Alpha alphaLifecycleAdmin LongRandomSecretKey
   mc admin policy set Alpha LifecycleAdminPolicy user=alphaLifecycleAdmin

This example assumes that the specified
aliases have the necessary permissions for creating policies and users
on the deployment. See :ref:`minio-users` and :ref:`MinIO Policy Based Access Control <minio-policy>` for more
complete documentation on MinIO users and policies respectively.
