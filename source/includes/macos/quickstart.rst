.. |OS| replace:: MacOS

This procedure deploys a :ref:`Single-Node Single-Drive <minio-installation-comparison>` MinIO server onto |OS| for early development and evaluation of MinIO Object Storage and its S3-compatible API layer.

For instructions on deploying to production environments, see :ref:`deploy-minio-distributed`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Read, write, and execute permissions for the user's home directory
- Familiarity with using the Terminal

Procedure
---------

#. **Install the MinIO Server**

   .. include:: /includes/macos/common-installation.rst
      :start-after: start-install-minio-binary-desc
      :end-before: end-install-minio-binary-desc

 
#. **Launch the MinIO Server**

   .. include:: /includes/macos/common-installation.rst
      :start-after: start-run-minio-binary-desc
      :end-before: end-run-minio-binary-desc

#. **Connect your Browser to the MinIO Server**

   Access the :ref:`minio-console` by going to a browser (such as Safari) and going to ``https://127.0.0.1:9000`` or one of the Console addresses specified in the :mc:`minio server` command's output.
   For example, :guilabel:`Console: http://192.0.2.10:9001 http://127.0.0.1:9001` in the example output indicates two possible addresses to use for connecting to the Console.

   While port ``9000`` is used for connecting to the API, MinIO automatically redirects browser access to the MinIO Console.

   Log in to the Console with the ``RootUser`` and ``RootPass`` user credentials displayed in the output.
   These default to ``minioadmin | minioadmin``.

   You can use the MinIO Console for general administration tasks like Identity and Access Management, Metrics and Log Monitoring, or Server Configuration. 
   Each MinIO server includes its own embedded MinIO Console.

   For more information, see the :ref:`minio-console` documentation.

#. `(Optional)` Install the MinIO Client

   The :ref:`MinIO Client <minio-client>` allows you to work with your MinIO volume from the commandline.

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Homebrew

         Run the following commands to install the latest stable MinIO Client package using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_.

         .. code-block:: shell
            :class: copyable

            brew install minio/stable/mc

         To use the command, run 
         
         .. code-block::
            
            mc {command} {flag}

      .. tab-item:: Binary (arm64)

         Download the standalone MinIO server for MacOS and make it executable.
           
         .. code-block:: shell
            :class: copyable

            curl -O https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/darwin-arm64/mc
            chmod +x mc
            sudo mv mc /usr/local/bin/mc
   
         To use the command, run 
         
         .. code-block:: shell
            
            mc {command} {flag}

      .. tab-item:: Binary (amd64)

         Download the standalone MinIO server for MacOS and make it executable.     

         .. code-block:: shell
            :class: copyable

            curl -O https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/darwin-amd64/mc
            chmod +x mc
            sudo mv mc /usr/local/bin/mc

         To use the command, run 
         
         .. code-block:: shell
            
            mc {command} {flag}
            
   Use :mc:`mc alias set` to quickly authenticate and connect to the MinIO deployment.

   .. code-block:: shell
      :class: copyable

      mc alias set local http://127.0.0.1:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
      mc admin info local

   The :mc:`mc alias set` takes four arguments:

   - The name of the alias
   - The hostname or IP address and port of the MinIO server
   - The Access Key for a MinIO :ref:`user <minio-users>`
   - The Secret Key for a MinIO :ref:`user <minio-users>`

   For additional details about this command, see :ref:`alias`.
