=====================================
MinIO High Performance Object Storage
=====================================

.. default-domain:: minio

Welcome to the MinIO Documentation! MinIO is a high performance object storage 
solution with native support for Kubernetes deployments. MinIO provides an 
Amazon Web Services S3-compatible API and supports all core S3 features. 

You can get started exploring MinIO features using our ``play`` server at
https://play.min.io. ``play`` is a *public* MinIO cluster running the latest
stable MinIO server. Any file uploaded to ``play`` should be considered public
and non-protected.

The MinIO Client :mc:`mc` commandline interface includes an
:mc-cmd:`alias <mc alias>` for the ``play`` server. After 
`Downloading the MinIO Client <https://min.io/downloads>`__, use the 
``play`` alias to perform S3-compatible object storage operations:

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   mc alias list play
   mc mb --with-lock play/mynewbucket
   mc cp ~/data/mytestdata play/mynewbucket

See the :doc:`MinIO Client Complete Reference </reference/minio-cli/minio-mc>`
for complete documentation on the available :mc:`mc` commands.

- First-time users of MinIO *or* object storage services should start with 
  our :doc:`Introduction </introduction/minio-overview>`.

- Users deploying onto a Kubernetes cluster should start with our 
  :docs-k8s:`Kubernetes documentation <>`.

Quickstart
----------

The following steps deploys MinIO in filesystem mode with a single folder or
disk on the local host. This deployment is best used for initial evaluation of
MinIO S3-compatible object storage. Filesystem mode does not support features
such as versioning and replication.

1\) Create a Data Folder
   Create a folder on the local drive for MinIO to use for object storage
   operations. For example:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :class: copyable

      mkdir /mnt/data
      sudo chmod -R 775 /mnt/data
      
2\) Download MinIO Server and Commandline Tools
   Visit `https://min.io/downloads <https://min.io/downloads?ref=docs>`__ and
   following the instructions for your host operating system to download and
   configure the :mc:`minio` and :mc:`mc` binaries.  Consider adding the
   ``minio`` and ``mc`` binaries to the operating system PATH for simplified
   operations.

   Follow the instructions on the download site to start the :mc:`minio server`
   process. For example, the following command starts the
   :mc:`minio server` using the created directory:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :class: copyable

      export MINIO_ROOT_USER=myminioaccesskey
      export MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=myminiosecretkey

      minio server /mnt/data

   .. list-table::
      :stub-columns: 1
      :widths: 30 60
      :width: 100%

      * - :envvar:`MINIO_ROOT_USER`
        - The :ref:`root user <minio-users-root>` access key. Replace the
          sample value with a long, random, and unique string.

      * - :envvar:`MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`
        - The :ref:`root user <minio-users-root>` secret key. Replace the
          sample value with a long, random, and unique string.

   The output resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: shell

      API: http://127.0.0.1:9000      
      RootUser: minioadmin
      RootPass: minioadmin
      Region:   us-east-1
      Console: http://127.0.0.1:64518 
      RootUser: minioadmin
      RootPass: minioadmin
      Command-line: https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide
         $ mc alias set myminio http://127.0.0.1:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
      Documentation: https://docs.min.io

   Applications should use one of the addresses listed in the :guilabel:`API`
   key for connecting to and performing operations on the MinIO Tenant. 
   For early development and application, applications can authenticate
   using the :guilabel:`RootUser` and :guilabel:`RootPass` credentials.
   For long-term development and production, create dedicated users. 
   See :doc:`/security/security-overview` for more information.

   You can also use the :mc:`mc` commandline tool to perform operations on the
   MinIO server. Use :mc:`mc alias set` to update the ``myminio`` alias with
   the access key and secret key set on the MinIO server.

3\) Open MinIO Console
   Open your browser and http://127.0.0.1:9000 to open the 
   :ref:`MinIO Console <minio-console>` login page.
   
   Log in with the :guilabel:`Root User` and :guilabel:`Root Pass` from the
   previous step.

   You can use the MinIO Console for general administration tasks like
   Identity and Access Management, Metrics and Log Monitoring, or 
   Server Configuration. See :ref:`minio-console` for more information.
