Licensing
---------

We have designed MinIO as an Open Source software for the Open Source software
community. This requires applications to consider whether their usage of MinIO
is in compliance with the 
:minio-git:`GNU AGPLv3 license <mc/blob/master/LICENSE>`.

MinIO cannot make the determination as to whether your application's usage of
MinIO is in compliance with the AGPLv3 license requirements. You should instead
rely on your own legal counsel or licensing specialists to audit and ensure your
application is in compliance with the licenses of MinIO and all other
open-source projects with which your application integrates or interacts. We
understand that AGPLv3 licensing is complex and nuanced. It is for that reason
we strongly encourage using experts in licensing to make any such determinations
around compliance instead of relying on apocryphal or anecdotal advice.

`MinIO Commercial Licensing <https://min.io/pricing>`__ is the best option for
applications that trigger AGPLv3 obligations (e.g. open sourcing your
application). Applications using MinIO - or any other OSS-licensed code -
without validating their usage do so at their own risk.
