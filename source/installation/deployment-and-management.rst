MinIO is a software-defined high performance distributed object storage server.
You can run MinIO on consumer or enterprise-grade hardware and a variety
of operating systems and architectures.

MinIO supports two deployment modes: :guilabel:`Standalone` and 
:guilabel:`Distributed`:

Standalone Deployments
   A single MinIO server with a single storage volume or folder. Standalone deployments are best suited for evaluation and initial development of applications using MinIO for object storage, *or* for providing an S3 access layer to single storage volume. Standalone deployments do not provide access to the full set of MinIO's advanced S3 features and functionality - specifically those dependent on :ref:`Erasure Coding <minio-erasure-coding>`.

Distributed Deployments
   One or more MinIO servers with *at least* four total storage volumes across all servers. Distributed deployments are best for production environments and workloads and support all of MinIO's core and advanced S3 features and functionality.

   MinIO recommends a baseline topology of 4 nodes with 4 drives each for production environments.

:guilabel:`Standalone` and :guilabel:`Distributed` MinIO deployments:

Platform Support
----------------

MinIO provides builds of the MinIO server (:mc:`minio`) and the
MinIO :abbr:`CLI (Command Line Interface)` (:mc:`mc`) for the following
platforms. 

.. list-table::
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 80
   :width: 100%

   * - Linux
     - MinIO recommends RHEL8+ or Ubuntu 18.04+.
   
       MinIO provides builds for the following architectures:

       - AMD64
       - ARM64
       - PowerPC 64 LE
       - S390X

   * - macOS
     - MinIO recommends non-EOL macOS versions (10.14+).

   * - Microsoft Windows
     - MinIO recommends non-EOL Windows versions (Windows 10, Windows Server 
       2016+). Support for running :ref:`distributed MinIO deployments 
       <deploy-minio-distributed>` is *experimental* on Windows OS.


For unlisted platforms or architectures, please reach out to MinIO at 
hello@min.io for additional support and guidance. You can build MinIO from
:minio-git:`source <minio/#install-from-source>` and 
`cross-compile 
<https://golang.org/doc/install/source#bootstrapFromCrosscompiledSource>`__
for your platform and architecture combo. MinIO generally does not recommend
source-based installations in production environments.
