The following checklists provide a high-level guideline for validating production-readiness of MinIO deployments.

These checklists may not meet the precise requirements of your unique deployment topology or architecture, and are intended as a best-effort guide to reliable production deployments.

|subnet| users can `log in <https://subnet.min.io/?ref=docs>`__ and create a new issue for pre-production deployment reviews. 
Coordination with MinIO Engineering via SUBNET ensures end-to-end support for performant and reliable deployments.

Community users can seek support on the `MinIO Community Slack <https://slack.min.io>`__. 
Community Support is best-effort only and has no SLAs around responsiveness.

Checklists:

- :ref:`Security Checklist <minio-security-checklist>`
- :ref:`Software Checklist <minio-software-checklists>`
- :ref:`Thresholds and Limits <minio-server-limits>`
