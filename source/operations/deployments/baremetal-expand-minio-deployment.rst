MinIO supports expanding an existing distributed deployment by adding a new :ref:`Server Pool <minio-intro-server-pool>`. 
Each Pool expands the total available storage capacity of the cluster.

Expansion does not provide Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)-grade protections.
While each pool is an independent set of servers with distinct :ref:`erasure sets <minio-ec-erasure-set>` for availability, the complete loss of one pool results in MinIO stopping I/O for all pools in the deployment.
Similarly, an erasure set which loses quorum in one pool represents data loss of objects stored in that set, regardless of the number of other erasure sets or pools.

The new server pool does **not** need to use the same type or size of hardware and software configuration as any existing server pool, though doing so may allow for simplified cluster management and more predictable performance across pools.
All drives in the new pool **should** be of the same type and size within the new pool.
Review MinIO's :ref:`hardware recommendations <minio-hardware-checklist>` for more complete guidance on selecting an appropriate configuration.

To provide BC-DR grade failover and recovery support for your single or multi-pool MinIO deployments, use :ref:`site replication <minio-site-replication-overview>`.

The procedure on this page expands an existing :ref:`distributed <deploy-minio-distributed>` MinIO deployment with an additional server pool. 

.. _expand-minio-distributed-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

Networking and Firewalls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each node should have full bidirectional network access to every other node in
the deployment. For containerized or orchestrated infrastructures, this may
require specific configuration of networking and routing components such as
ingress or load balancers. Certain operating systems may also require setting
firewall rules. For example, the following command explicitly opens the default
MinIO server API port ``9000`` on servers using ``firewalld``:

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=9000/tcp
   firewall-cmd --reload

All MinIO servers in the deployment *must* use the same listen port.

If you set a static :ref:`MinIO Console <minio-console>` port (e.g. ``:9001``)
you must *also* grant access to that port to ensure connectivity from external
clients.

MinIO **strongly recomends** using a load balancer to manage connectivity to the
cluster. The Load Balancer should use a "Least Connections" algorithm for
routing requests to the MinIO deployment, since any MinIO node in the deployment
can receive, route, or process client requests. 

The following load balancers are known to work well with MinIO:

- `NGINX <https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/load-balancing/>`__
- `HAProxy <https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/2.3/intro.html#3.3.5>`__

Configuring firewalls or load balancers to support MinIO is out of scope for
this procedure.
The :ref:`integrations-nginx-proxy` reference provides a baseline configuration for using NGINX as a reverse proxy with basic load balancing configured.

Sequential Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MinIO *requires* using expansion notation ``{x...y}`` to denote a sequential
series of MinIO hosts when creating a server pool. MinIO therefore *requires*
using sequentially-numbered hostnames to represent each
:mc:`minio server` process in the pool. 

Create the necessary DNS hostname mappings *prior* to starting this procedure.
For example, the following hostnames would support a 4-node distributed
server pool:

- ``minio5.example.com``
- ``minio6.example.com``
- ``minio7.example.com``
- ``minio8.example.com``

You can specify the entire range of hostnames using the expansion notation
``minio{5...8}.example.com``.

Configuring DNS to support MinIO is out of scope for this procedure.

Storage Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |deployment| replace:: server pool

.. include:: /includes/common-installation.rst
   :start-after: start-storage-requirements-desc
   :end-before: end-storage-requirements-desc

.. include:: /includes/common-admonitions.rst
   :start-after: start-exclusive-drive-access
   :end-before: end-exclusive-drive-access

Minimum Drives for Erasure Code Parity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MinIO requires each pool satisfy the deployment :ref:`erasure code
<minio-erasure-coding>` settings. Specifically the new pool topology must 
support a minimum of ``2 x EC:N`` drives per 
:ref:`erasure set <minio-ec-erasure-set>`, where ``EC:N`` is the 
:ref:`Standard <minio-ec-storage-class>` parity storage class of the
deployment. This requirement ensures the new server pool can satisfy the
expected :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` of the deployment.

You can use the 
`MinIO Erasure Code Calculator 
<https://min.io/product/erasure-code-calculator?ref=docs>`__ to check the
:guilabel:`Erasure Code Stripe Size (K+M)` of your new pool. If the highest
listed value is at least ``2 x EC:N``, the pool supports the deployment's
erasure parity settings.

Time Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multi-node systems must maintain synchronized time and date to maintain stable internode operations and interactions.
Make sure all nodes sync to the same time server regularly.
Operating systems vary for methods used to synchronize time and date, such as with ``ntp``, ``timedatectl``, or ``timesyncd``.

Check the documentation for your operating system for how to set up and maintain accurate and identical system clock times across nodes.

Back Up Cluster Settings First
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :mc:`mc admin cluster bucket export` and :mc:`mc admin cluster iam export` commands to take a snapshot of the bucket metadata and IAM configurations respectively prior to starting decommissioning.
You can use these snapshots to restore :ref:`bucket <minio-mc-admin-cluster-bucket-import>` and :ref:`IAM <minio-mc-admin-cluster-iam-import>` settings to recover from user or process errors as necessary.

Considerations
--------------

.. _minio-writing-files:

Writing Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MinIO does not automatically rebalance objects across the new server pools. 
Instead, MinIO performs new write operations to the pool with the most free
storage weighted by the amount of free space on the pool divided by the free space across all available pools.

The formula to determine the probability of a write operation on a particular pool is

:math:`FreeSpaceOnPoolA / FreeSpaceOnAllPools`

Consider a situation where a group of three pools has a total of 10 TiB of free space distributed as:

- Pool A has 3 TiB of free space
- Pool B has 2 TiB of free space
- Pool C has 5 TiB of free space

MinIO calculates the probability of a write operation to each of the pools as:

- Pool A: 30% chance (:math:`3TiB / 10TiB`)
- Pool B: 20% chance (:math:`2TiB / 10TiB`)
- Pool C: 50% chance (:math:`5TiB / 10TiB`)

In addition to the free space calculation, if a write option (with parity) would bring a drive
usage above 99% or a known free inode count below 1000, MinIO does not write to the pool.

If desired, you can manually initiate a rebalance procedure with :mc:`mc admin rebalance`.
For more about how rebalancing works, see :ref:`managing objects across a deployment <minio-rebalance>`.

Likewise, MinIO does not write to pools in a decommissioning process.

Expansion is Non-Disruptive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a new server pool requires restarting *all* MinIO server processes in the
deployment at around same time. 

.. include:: /includes/common-installation.rst
   :start-after: start-nondisruptive-upgrade-desc
   :end-before: end-nondisruptive-upgrade-desc

Capacity-Based Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MinIO recommends planning storage capacity sufficient to store **at least** 2 years of data before reaching 70% usage.
Performing :ref:`server pool expansion <expand-minio-distributed>` more frequently or on a "just-in-time" basis generally indicates an architecture or planning issue.

For example, consider an application suite expected to produce at least 100 TiB of data per year and a 3 year target before expansion.
The deployment has ~500TiB of usable storage in the initial server pool, such that the cluster safely met the 70% threshold with some buffer for data growth.
The new server pool should **ideally** meet at minimum 500TiB of additional storage to allow for a similar lifespan before further expansion.

Since MinIO :ref:`erasure coding <minio-erasure-coding>` requires some storage for parity, the total **raw** storage must exceed the planned **usable** capacity. 
Consider using the MinIO `Erasure Code Calculator <https://min.io/product/erasure-code-calculator>`__ for guidance in planning capacity around specific erasure code settings.

Recommended Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial assumes all hosts running MinIO use a :ref:`recommended Linux operating system <minio-installation-platform-support>`. 

All hosts in the deployment should run with matching :ref:`software configurations <minio-software-checklists>`.

.. _expand-minio-distributed-baremetal:

Expand a Distributed MinIO Deployment
-------------------------------------

The following procedure adds a :ref:`Server Pool <minio-intro-server-pool>`
to an existing MinIO deployment. Each Pool expands the total available
storage capacity of the cluster while maintaining the overall 
:ref:`availability <minio-erasure-coding>` of the cluster.

All commands provided below use example values. Replace these values with
those appropriate for your deployment.

Review the :ref:`expand-minio-distributed-prereqs` before starting this
procedure.

Complete any planned hardware expansion prior to :ref:`decommissioning older hardware pools <minio-decommissioning>`.

1) Install the MinIO Binary on Each Node in the New Server Pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/linux/common-installation.rst
   :start-after: start-install-minio-binary-desc
   :end-before: end-install-minio-binary-desc

2) Add TLS/SSL Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/common-installation.rst
   :start-after: start-install-minio-tls-desc
   :end-before: end-install-minio-tls-desc

3) Create the ``systemd`` Service File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/linux/common-installation.rst
   :start-after: start-install-minio-systemd-desc
   :end-before: end-install-minio-systemd-desc

4) Create the Service Environment File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create an environment file at ``/etc/default/minio``. The MinIO 
service uses this file as the source of all 
:ref:`environment variables <minio-server-environment-variables>` used by
MinIO *and* the ``minio.service`` file.

The following examples assumes that:

- The deployment has a single server pool consisting of four MinIO server hosts
  with sequential hostnames.

  .. code-block:: shell

     minio1.example.com   minio3.example.com   
     minio2.example.com   minio4.example.com   

  Each host has 4 locally attached drives with
  sequential mount points:

  .. code-block:: shell

     /mnt/disk1/minio   /mnt/disk3/minio 
     /mnt/disk2/minio   /mnt/disk4/minio

- The new server pool consists of eight new MinIO hosts with sequential
  hostnames:

  .. code-block:: shell

     minio5.example.com   minio9.example.com
     minio6.example.com   minio10.example.com
     minio7.example.com   minio11.example.com
     minio8.example.com   minio12.example.com

- All hosts have eight locally-attached drives with sequential mount-points:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     /mnt/disk1/minio  /mnt/disk5/minio
     /mnt/disk2/minio  /mnt/disk6/minio
     /mnt/disk3/minio  /mnt/disk7/minio
     /mnt/disk4/minio  /mnt/disk8/minio

- The deployment has a load balancer running at ``https://minio.example.net``
  that manages connections across all MinIO hosts. The load balancer should
  not be routing requests to the new hosts at this step, but should have 
  the necessary configuration updates planned.

Modify the example to reflect your deployment topology:

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   # Set the hosts and volumes MinIO uses at startup
   # The command uses MinIO expansion notation {x...y} to denote a
   # sequential series. 
   # 
   # The following example starts the MinIO server with two server pools.
   #
   # The space delimiter indicates a seperate server pool
   #
   # The second set of hostnames and volumes is the newly added pool.
   # The pool has sufficient stripe size to meet the existing erasure code
   # parity of the deployment (2 x EC:4)
   #
   # The command includes the port on which the MinIO servers listen for each
   # server pool.

   MINIO_VOLUMES="https://minio{1...4}.example.net:9000/mnt/disk{1...4}/minio https://minio{5...12}.example.net:9000/mnt/disk{1...8}/minio"

   # Set all MinIO server options
   #
   # The following explicitly sets the MinIO Console listen address to
   # port 9001 on all network interfaces. The default behavior is dynamic
   # port selection.

   MINIO_OPTS="--console-address :9001"

   # Set the root username. This user has unrestricted permissions to
   # perform S3 and administrative API operations on any resource in the
   # deployment.
   #
   # Defer to your organizations requirements for superadmin user name.

   MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin

   # Set the root password
   #
   # Use a long, random, unique string that meets your organizations
   # requirements for passwords.

   MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minio-secret-key-CHANGE-ME

You may specify other :ref:`environment variables
<minio-server-environment-variables>` or server commandline options as required
by your deployment. All MinIO nodes in the deployment should include the same
environment variables with the matching values.

5) Restart the MinIO Deployment with Expanded Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following commands on each node **simultaneously** in the deployment
to restart the MinIO service:

.. include:: /includes/linux/common-installation.rst
   :start-after: start-install-minio-restart-service-desc
   :end-before: end-install-minio-restart-service-desc

.. include:: /includes/common-installation.rst
   :start-after: start-nondisruptive-upgrade-desc
   :end-before: end-nondisruptive-upgrade-desc

6) Next Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update any load balancers, reverse proxies, or other network control planes
  to route client requests to the new hosts in the MinIO distributed deployment.
  While MinIO automatically manages routing internally, having the control
  planes handle initial connection management may reduce network hops and
  improve efficiency.

- Review the :ref:`MinIO Console <minio-console>` to confirm the updated
  cluster topology and monitor performance.
