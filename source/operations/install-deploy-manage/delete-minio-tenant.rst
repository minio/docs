Prerequisites
-------------

MinIO Kubernetes Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedures on this page *requires* a valid installation of the MinIO Kubernetes Operator and assumes the local host has a matching installation of the MinIO Kubernetes Operator.
This procedure assumes the latest stable Operator, version |operator-version-stable|.

See :ref:`deploy-operator-kubernetes` for complete documentation on deploying the MinIO Operator.


Procedure (CLI)
---------------

Use Kustomize to delete a MinIO Tenant and its associated resources.

The delete behavior of each Persistent Volume Claims (``PVC``) generated by the Tenant depends on the :kube-docs:`Reclaim Policy <concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reclaim-policy>` of its bound Persistent Volume (``PV``):

- For ``recycle`` or ``delete`` policies, the command deletes the ``PVC``.

- For ``retain``, the command retains the ``PVC``.

.. warning::

   Deletion of the underlying ``PV``, whether automatic or manual, results in the loss of any objects stored on the MinIO Tenant. 

   Perform all due diligence in ensuring the safety of stored data *prior* to deleting the Tenant.
