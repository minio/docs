You can :ref:`deploy a MinIO Tenant <minio-k8s-deploy-minio-tenant>` through the 
Operator Console.

The Operator Console automatically detects any MinIO Tenants 
deployed on the cluster, whether provisioned through the Operator Console 
or through the :ref:`MinIO Kubernetes Plugin <minio-k8s-deploy-minio-tenant-commandline>`.

Select a listed tenant to open an in-browser view of that tenant's MinIO Console. 
You can use this view to directly manage, modify, expand, upgrade, and delete the tenant through the Operator UI.
