The following procedures upgrade a single MinIO Tenant, using either Kustomize or Helm.
MinIO recommends you test upgrades in a lower environment such as a Dev or QA Tenant, before upgrading production Tenants.

.. important::

   For Tenants using a MinIO Image older than :minio-release:`RELEASE.2024-03-30T09-41-56Z` running with :ref:`AD/LDAP <minio-ldap-config-settings>` enabled, you **must** read through the release notes for :minio-release:`RELEASE.2024-04-18T19-09-19Z` before starting this procedure.
   You must take the extra steps documented in the linked release as part of the upgrade procedure.

Upgrade a Tenant using Kustomize
--------------------------------

The following procedure upgrades a MinIO Tenant using Kustomize and the ``kubectl`` CLI.
If you deployed the Tenant using :ref:`Helm <deploy-tenant-helm>`, use the :ref:`minio-upgrade-tenant-helm` procedure instead.

To upgrade a Tenant with Kustomize:

If the tenant was deployed with Operator Console, there are additional steps to create a base configuration file before upgrading.

If the tenant was deployed with Kustomize, the base configuration is your existing ``kustomization`` files from the original tenant deployment.

Choose a tab below depending on how the tenant was deployed:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Operator Console-Deployed Tenant
      :selected:

      1. Create the base configuration file:

         a. In a convenient directory, save the current Tenant configuration to a file using ``kubectl get``:

             .. code-block:: shell
                :class: copyable

                kubectl get tenant/my-tenant -n my-tenant-ns -o yaml > my-tenant-base.yaml

             Replace ``my-tenant`` and ``my-tenant-ns`` with the name and namespace of the Tenant to upgrade.

             Edit the file to remove the following lines:

             - ``creationTimestamp:``
             - ``resourceVersion:``
             - ``uid:``
             - ``selfLink:`` (if present)

             For example, remove the highlighted lines:

             .. code-block:: shell
                :emphasize-lines: 2, 6, 7

                metadata:
                  creationTimestamp: "2024-05-29T21:22:20Z"
                  generation: 1
                  name: my-tenant
                  namespace: my-tenant-ns
                  resourceVersion: "4699"
                  uid: d5b8e468-3bed-4aa3-8ddb-dfe1ee0362da

         b. In the same directory, create a ``kustomization.yaml`` file with contents resembling the following:

            .. code-block:: shell
               :class: copyable

               apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
               kind: Kustomization

               resources:
               - my-tenant-base.yaml

               patches:
               - path: upgrade-minio-tenant.yaml

            If you used a different filename for the ``kubectl get`` output in the previous step, replace ``my-tenant-base.yaml`` with the name of that file.

   .. tab-item:: Existing Kustomized-deployed Tenant

      1. You can upgrade the tenant using the ``kustomization`` files from the original deployment as the base configuration.
         If you no longer have these files, follow the instructions in the Operator Console-Deployed Tenant tab.

2. Create a ``upgrade-minio-tenant.yaml`` file with contents resembling the following:

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable
   :substitutions:

   apiVersion: minio.min.io/v2
   kind: Tenant

   metadata:
     name: my-tenant
     namespace: my-tenant-ns

   spec:
     image: minio/minio:|minio-tag|

This file instructs Kustomize to upgrade the tenant using the specified image.
The name of this file, ``upgrade-minio-tenant.yaml``, must match the ``patches.path`` filename specified in the ``kustomization.yaml`` file created in the previous step.

Replace ``my-tenant`` and ``my-tenant-ns`` with the name and namespace of the Tenant to upgrade.
Specify the MinIO version to upgrade to in ``image:``.

Alternatively, you can update the base configuration directly, according to your local procedures.
Refer to the :kube-docs:`Kustomize Documentation <tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization>` for more information.

3. From the same directory as the above files, apply the updated configuration to the Tenant with ``kubectl apply``:

  .. code-block:: shell
     :class: copyable

     kubectl apply -f ./

  The output resembles the following:

  .. code-block:: shell

     tenant.minio.min.io/my-tenant configured


.. _minio-upgrade-tenant-helm:

Upgrade the Tenant using the MinIO Helm Chart
---------------------------------------------

This procedure upgrades an existing MinIO Tenant using Helm Charts.

If you deployed the Tenant using Kustomize, use the :ref:`minio-upgrade-tenant-kustomize` procedure instead.

1. Verify the existing MinIO Tenant installation.

   Use ``kubectl get all -n TENANT_NAMESPACE`` to verify the health and status of all Tenant pods and services.

   Use the ``helm list`` command to view the installed charts in the namespace:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :class: copyable

      helm list -n TENANT_NAMESPACE

   The result should resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: shell


      NAME            NAMESPACE         REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
      CHART_NAME      TENANT_NAMESPACE  1               2023-11-01 15:49:58.810412732 -0400 EDT deployed        tenant-5.0.x   v5.0.x

#. Update the Operator Repository 

   Use ``helm repo update minio-operator`` to update the MinIO Operator repo.
   If you set a different alias for the MinIO Operator repository, specify that to the command.
   You can use ``helm repo list`` to review your installed repositories.

   Use ``helm search`` to check the latest available chart version after updating the Operator Repo:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :class: copyable

      helm search repo minio-operator

   The response should resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :class: copyable
      :substitutions:

      NAME                            CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION                    
      minio-operator/minio-operator   4.3.7           v4.3.7          A Helm chart for MinIO Operator
      minio-operator/operator         |operator-version-stable|          v|operator-version-stable|         A Helm chart for MinIO Operator
      minio-operator/tenant           |operator-version-stable|          v|operator-version-stable|         A Helm chart for MinIO Operator

   The ``minio-operator/minio-operator`` is a legacy chart and should **not** be installed under normal circumstances.

#. Run ``helm upgrade``

   Helm uses the latest chart to upgrade the Tenant:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :class: copyable

      helm upgrade -n minio-tenant \
        CHART_NAME minio-operator/tenant

   The command results should return success with a bump in the ``REVISION`` value.

#. Validate the Tenant Upgrade

   Check that all services and pods are online and functioning normally.
