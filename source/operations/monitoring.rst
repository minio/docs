Metrics and Alerts
------------------

MinIO provides point-in-time metrics on cluster status and operations.
MinIO publishes collected metrics data using Prometheus-compatible data structures. 

For alerts, time-series metric data, or additional metrics, MinIO can leverage `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`__.
Prometheus is an Open Source systems and service monitoring system which supports analyzing and alerting based on collected metrics.
The Prometheus ecosystem includes multiple :prometheus-docs:`integrations <operating/integrations/>`, allowing wide latitude in processing and storing collected metrics.

- MinIO publishes Prometheus-compatible scraping endpoints for cluster and node-level metrics. 
  Any Prometheus-compatible scraping software can ingest and process MinIO metrics for analysis, visualization, and alerting.
  See :ref:`minio-metrics-and-alerts-endpoints` for more information.

- For alerts, use Prometheus :prometheus-docs:`Alerting Rules  <prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/>` and the
  :prometheus-docs:`Alert Manager <alerting/latest/overview/>` to trigger alerts based on collected metrics. 
  See :ref:`minio-metrics-and-alerts-alerting` for more information.

When configured, the :ref:`MinIO Console <minio-console-metrics>` shows some metrics in the :guilabel:`Monitoring > Metrics` page.
You can download these metrics as either ``.png`` images or ``.csv`` files.

Logging
-------

MinIO publishes all :mc:`minio server` operations to the system console. 
MinIO also supports publishing server logs and audit logs to an HTTP webhook.

- :ref:`Server logs <minio-logging-publish-server-logs>` contain the same :mc:`minio server` operations logged to the system console. 
  Server logs support general monitoring and troubleshooting of operations.

- :ref:`Audit logs <minio-logging-publish-audit-logs>` are more granular descriptions of each operation on the MinIO deployment. 
  Audit logging supports security standards and regulations which require detailed tracking of operations.

MinIO publishes logs as a JSON document as a ``PUT`` request to each configured endpoint. 
The endpoint server is responsible for processing each JSON document.
MinIO requires explicit configuration of each webhook endpoint and does *not* publish logs to a webhook by default.

See :ref:`minio-logging` for more complete documentation.

Healthchecks
------------

MinIO exposes unauthenticated endpoints for probing node uptime and  cluster :ref:`high availability <minio-ec-parity>` for simple healthchecks.
These endpoints return only an HTTP status code. 
See :ref:`minio-healthcheck-api` for more information.
