Metrics and Alerts
------------------

MinIO publishes point-in-time metrics using the :prometheus-docs:`Prometheus Data Model <concepts/data_model/>`.
You can use any scraping tool which supports that data model to pull those metrics into a database for populating historical views, performing query/analysis of metrics data, or creating alerts on preferred data points.

The following table lists tutorials for integrating MinIO metrics with select third-party monitoring software.

.. list-table::
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   :width: 100%

   * - :ref:`minio-metrics-collect-using-prometheus`
     - Configure Prometheus to Monitor and Alert for a MinIO deployment

       Configure MinIO to query the Prometheus deployment to enable historical metrics via the MinIO Console

   * - :ref:`minio-metrics-influxdb`
     - Configure InfluxDB to Monitor and Alert for a MinIO deployment.

Other metrics and analytics software suites which support the Prometheus data model may work regardless of their inclusion on the above list.

Logging
-------

MinIO publishes all :mc:`minio server` operations to the system console. 
MinIO also supports publishing server logs and audit logs to an HTTP webhook.

- :ref:`Server logs <minio-logging-publish-server-logs>` contain the same :mc:`minio server` operations logged to the system console. 
  Server logs support general monitoring and troubleshooting of operations.

- :ref:`Audit logs <minio-logging-publish-audit-logs>` are more granular descriptions of each operation on the MinIO deployment. 
  Audit logging supports security standards and regulations which require detailed tracking of operations.

MinIO publishes logs as a JSON document as a ``PUT`` request to each configured endpoint. 
The endpoint server is responsible for processing each JSON document.
MinIO requires explicit configuration of each webhook endpoint and does *not* publish logs to a webhook by default.

See :ref:`minio-logging` for more complete documentation.

Healthchecks
------------

MinIO exposes unauthenticated endpoints for probing node uptime and  cluster :ref:`high availability <minio-ec-parity>` for simple healthchecks.
These endpoints return only an HTTP status code. 
See :ref:`minio-healthcheck-api` for more information.
