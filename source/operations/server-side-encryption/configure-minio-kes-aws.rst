MinIO Server-Side Encryption (SSE) protects objects as part of write operations, allowing clients to take advantage of server processing power to secure objects at the storage layer (encryption-at-rest). 
SSE also provides key functionality to regulatory and compliance requirements around secure locking and erasure.

MinIO SSE uses |KES-git| and an external root Key Management Service (KMS) for performing secured cryptographic operations at scale. 
The root KMS provides stateful and secured storage of External Keys (EK) while |KES| is stateless and derives additional cryptographic keys from the root-managed |EK|. 

.. Conditionals to handle the slight divergences in procedures between platforms.

.. cond:: linux

   This procedure provides guidance for deploying and configuring KES at scale for a supporting |SSE| on a production MinIO deployment, with |rootkms| as the external root |KMS|.
   You can also use this procedure for deploying to local environments for testing and evaluation.

   As part of this procedure, you will:

   #. Deploy one or more |KES| servers configured to use |rootkms| as the root |KMS|.
      You may optionally deploy a load balancer for managing connections to those KES servers.

   #. Create a new |EK| on |rootkms-short| for use with |SSE|.

   #. Create or modify a MinIO deployment with support for |SSE| using |KES|.
      Defer to the :ref:`Deploy Distributed MinIO <minio-mnmd>` tutorial for guidance on production-ready MinIO deployments.

   #. Configure automatic bucket-default :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>`

   For production orchestrated environments, use the MinIO Kubernetes Operator to deploy a tenant with |SSE| enabled and configured for use with |rootkms-short|.

.. cond:: macos or windows

   This procedure assumes a single local host machine running the MinIO and KES processes, with |rootkms| as the external root |KMS|..
   As part of this procedure, you will:

   #. Deploy a |KES| server configured to use |rootkms| as the root |KMS|.

   #. Create a new |EK| on Vault for use with |SSE|.

   #. Deploy a MinIO server in :ref:`Single-Node Single-Drive mode <minio-snsd>` configured to use the |KES| container for supporting |SSE|.

   #. Configure automatic bucket-default :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>`.

   For production orchestrated environments, use the MinIO Kubernetes Operator to deploy a tenant with |SSE| enabled and configured for use with |rootkms-short|.

   For production baremetal environments, see the MinIO on Linux documentation for tutorials on configuring MinIO with KES and |rootkms-short|.

.. cond:: container

   This procedure assumes a single host machine running the MinIO and KES containers, with |rootkms| as the external root |KMS|..
   As part of this procedure, you will:

   #. Deploy a |KES| container configured to use |rootkms| as the root |KMS|.

   #. Create a new |EK| on Vault for use with |SSE|.

   #. Deploy a MinIO Server container in :ref:`Single-Node Single-Drive mode <minio-snsd>` configured to use the |KES| container for supporting |SSE|.

   #. Configure automatic bucket-default :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>`.

   For production orchestrated environments, use the MinIO Kubernetes Operator to deploy a tenant with |SSE| enabled and configured for use with |rootkms-short|.

   For production baremetal environments, see the MinIO on Linux documentation for tutorials on configuring MinIO with KES and |rootkms-short|.

.. cond:: k8s

   This procedure assumes you have access to a Kubernetes cluster with an active MinIO Operator installation, with a cluster-accessible |rootkms| service as the external root |KMS|.
   As part of this procedure, you will:

   #. Use the MinIO Operator Console to create or manage a MinIO Tenant.
   #. Access the :guilabel:`Encryption` settings for that tenant and configure |SSE| using |rootkms| as the root |KMS|.
   #. Create a new |EK| on Vault for use with |SSE|.
   #. Configure automatic bucket-default :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>`.

   For production baremetal environments, see the MinIO on Linux documentation for tutorials on configuring MinIO with KES and |rootkms-short|.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. cond:: k8s

   MinIO Kubernetes Operator and Plugin
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The procedures on this page *requires* a valid installation of the MinIO Kubernetes Operator and assumes the local host has a matching installation of the MinIO Kubernetes Operator. 
   This procedure assumes the latest stable Operator and Plugin version |operator-version-stable|.

   See :ref:`deploy-operator-kubernetes` for complete documentation on deploying the MinIO Operator.

.. _minio-sse-aws-prereq-aws:

Ensure Access to the AWS Secrets Manager and Key Management Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure assumes access to and familiarity with |rootkms| and |rootkms-short|.

.. cond:: k8s

   This procedure assumes your Kubernetes cluster configuration allows for cluster-internal pods and services to resolve and connect to endpoints outside of the cluster, such as the public internet.
   

MinIO specifically requires the following AWS settings or configurations:

- A new AWS :aws-docs:`Programmatic Access <IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html>` user  with corresponding access key and secret key.

- A policy that grants the created user access to AWS Secrets Manager and |rootkms-short|. 
  The following policy grants the minimum necessary permissions:

  .. code-block:: json
     :class: copyable

     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Sid": "minioSecretsManagerAccess",
           "Action": [
             "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
             "secretsmanager:DeleteSecret",
             "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
             "secretsmanager:ListSecrets"
           ],
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Resource": "*"
         },
         {
           "Sid": "minioKmsAccess",
           "Action": [
             "kms:Decrypt",
             "kms:DescribeKey",
             "kms:Encrypt"
           ],
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }

  
  AWS provides the ``SecretsManagerReadWrite`` and
  ``AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser`` canned roles that meet and exceed the
  minimum required permissions.

Configuration Reference for AWS Root KMS
----------------------------------------

The following section describes each of the |KES-git| configuration settings for using AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Key Management System as the root :abbr:`KMS (Key Management System)` for |SSE|:

.. important::

   Starting with :minio-release:`RELEASE.2023-02-17T17-52-43Z`, MinIO requires expanded KES permissions for functionality.
   The example configuration in this section contains all required permissions.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: YAML Overview

      Fields with ``${<STRING>}`` use the environment variable matching the ``<STRING>`` value. 
      You can use this functionality to set credentials without writing them to the configuration file.

      The YAML assumes a minimal set of permissions for the MinIO deployment accessing KES.
      As an alternative, you can omit the ``policy.minio-server`` section and instead set the ``${MINIO_IDENTITY}`` hash as the ``${ROOT_IDENTITY}``.

      .. code-block:: yaml

         address: 0.0.0.0:7373
         root: ${ROOT_IDENTITY}

         tls:
           key: kes-server.key
           cert: kes-server.cert
