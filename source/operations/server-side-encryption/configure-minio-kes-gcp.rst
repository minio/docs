MinIO Server-Side Encryption (SSE) protects objects as part of write operations,
allowing clients to take advantage of server processing power to secure objects
at the storage layer (encryption-at-rest). SSE also provides key functionality
to regulatory and compliance requirements around secure locking and erasure.

MinIO SSE uses |KES-git| and an
external root Key Management Service (KMS) for performing secured cryptographic
operations at scale. The root KMS provides stateful and secured storage of 
External Keys (EK) while |KES| is stateless and derives additional cryptographic
keys from the root-managed |EK|. 

.. Conditionals to handle the slight divergences in procedures between platforms.

.. cond:: linux

   This procedure provides guidance for deploying and configuring KES at scale for a supporting |SSE| on a production MinIO deployment.
   You can also use this procedure for deploying to local environments for testing and evaluation.

   As part of this procedure, you will:

   #. Deploy one or more |KES| servers configured to use |rootkms| as the root |KMS|.
      You may optionally deploy a load balancer for managing connections to those KES servers.

   #. Create a new |EK| on |rootkms-short| for use with |SSE|.

   #. Create or modify a MinIO deployment with support for |SSE| using |KES|.
      Defer to the :ref:`Deploy Distributed MinIO <minio-mnmd>` tutorial for guidance on production-ready MinIO deployments.

   #. Configure automatic bucket-default :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>`

   For production orchestrated environments, use the MinIO Kubernetes Operator to deploy a tenant with |SSE| enabled and configured for use with |rootkms-short|.

.. cond:: macos or windows

   This procedure assumes a single local host machine running the MinIO and KES processes.
   As part of this procedure, you will:

   #. Deploy a |KES| server configured to use |rootkms-short| as the root |KMS|.

   #. Create a new |EK| on |rootkms-short| for use with |SSE|.

   #. Deploy a MinIO server in :ref:`Single-Node Single-Drive mode <minio-snsd>` configured to use the |KES| container for supporting |SSE|.

   #. Configure automatic bucket-default :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>`.

   For production orchestrated environments, use the MinIO Kubernetes Operator to deploy a tenant with |SSE| enabled and configured for use with |rootkms-short|.

   For production baremetal environments, see the MinIO on Linux documentation for tutorials on configuring MinIO with KES and |rootkms-short|.

.. cond:: container

   This procedure assumes a single host machine running the MinIO and KES containers.
   As part of this procedure, you will:

   #. Deploy a |KES| container configured to use |rootkms-short| as the root |KMS|.

   #. Create a new |EK| on Vault for use with |SSE|.

   #. Deploy a MinIO Server container in :ref:`Single-Node Single-Drive mode <minio-snsd>` configured to use the |KES| container for supporting |SSE|.

   #. Configure automatic bucket-default :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>`.

   For production orchestrated environments, use the MinIO Kubernetes Operator to deploy a tenant with |SSE| enabled and configured for use with |rootkms-short|.

   For production baremetal environments, see the MinIO on Linux documentation for tutorials on configuring MinIO with KES and |rootkms-short|.

.. cond:: k8s

   This procedure assumes you have access to a Kubernetes cluster with an active MinIO Operator installation.
   As part of this procedure, you will:

   #. Use the MinIO Operator Console to create or manage a MinIO Tenant.
   #. Access the :guilabel:`Encryption` settings for that tenant and configure |SSE| using |rootkms-short|.
   #. Create a new |EK| on |rootkms-short| for use with |SSE|.
   #. Configure automatic bucket-default :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>`.

   For production baremetal environments, see the MinIO on Linux documentation for tutorials on configuring MinIO with KES and |rootkms-short|.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. cond:: k8s

   MinIO Kubernetes Operator and Plugin
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The procedures on this page *requires* a valid installation of the MinIO
   Kubernetes Operator and assumes the local host has a matching installation of
   the MinIO Kubernetes Operator. This procedure assumes the latest stable Operator
   and Plugin version |operator-version-stable|.

   See :ref:`deploy-operator-kubernetes` for complete documentation on deploying the MinIO Operator.

.. _minio-sse-gcp-prereq-gcp:

GCP Secret Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure assumes familiarity with 
`GCP Secret Manager <https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager>`__. 
The `Secret Manager Quickstart
<https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/quickstart>`__
provides a sufficient foundation for the purposes of this procedure.

.. cond:: k8s

   This procedure assumes your Kubernetes cluster configuration allows for cluster-internal pods and services to resolve and connect to endpoints outside the cluster, such as the public internet.

MinIO specifically requires the following GCP settings or
configurations:

- `Enable Secret Manager <https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/configuring-secret-manager>`__
  in the project.

- Create a new GCP Service Account for supporting |KES|. Ensure the user has
  a role with *at minimum* the following permissions:

  .. code-block:: text
     :class: copyable

     secretmanager.secrets.create
     secretmanager.secrets.delete
     secretmanager.secrets.get

  The ``Secret manager Admin`` role meets the minimum required permissions.

  GCP should return a set of credentials associated to the new access keys,
  including private keys. Copy these credentials to a safe and secure location
  for use with this procedure.

.. cond:: linux or macos or windows

   Deploy or Ensure Access to a MinIO Deployment
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/common/common-minio-kes.rst
      :start-after: start-kes-new-existing-minio-deployment-desc
      :end-before: end-kes-new-existing-minio-deployment-desc

.. cond:: container

   Install Podman or a Similar Container Management Interface
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/container/common-deploy.rst
      :start-after: start-common-prereq-container-management-interface
      :end-before: end-common-prereq-container-management-interface


.. The included file has the correct header structure.
   There are slight divergences between platforms so this ends up being easier compared to cascading conditionals to handle little nitty-gritty differences.

Configuration Reference for GCP Secret Manager Root KMS
-------------------------------------------------------

The following section describes each of the |KES-git| configuration settings for using GCP Secrets Manager as the root Key Management Service (KMS) for |SSE|:

.. important::

   Starting with :minio-release:`RELEASE.2023-02-17T17-52-43Z`, MinIO requires expanded KES permissions for functionality.
   The example configuration in this section contains all required permissions.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: YAML Overview

      Any field with value ``${VARIABLE}`` uses the environment variable with matching name as the value. 
      You can use this functionality to set credentials without writing them to the configuration file.

      The YAML assumes a minimal set of permissions for the MinIO deployment accessing KES.
      As an alternative, you can omit the ``policy.minio-server`` section and instead set the ``${MINIO_IDENTITY}`` hash as the ``${ROOT_IDENTITY}``.

      .. code-block:: yaml

         address: 0.0.0.0:7373
         root: ${ROOT_IDENTITY}
