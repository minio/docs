Reviewing Health Data in SUBNET
-------------------------------

SUBNET provides health data about the clusters registered to the organization from the :guilabel:`Deployments` section.

The view shows the total size of the org's MinIO clusters with details for each cluster.

Each of the organization's clusters display below the summary data.
Select a deployment row to view additional health details.

Deployment Health
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deployment's details include a summary of the deployment's configuration and the number of checks run and failed.
You can select :guilabel:`Upload` to add diagnostic health data obtained from the :mc:`mc support diagnostics` command or the MinIO Console's Support > Health page.

If you need support from MinIO Engineering, you can create a :guilabel:`New Issue` for the deployment.

SUBNET displays health checks for data points such as CPU, drives, memory, network, and security.

Failed checks display first.
Checks with warnings display after failed checks.
Checks that pass display last.

Uploading Data to SUBNET
------------------------

If you registered the cluster with SUBNET, Performance and Inspection files can automatically upload to SUBNET.

For clusters with an airgap, firewall, or otherwise blocked from SUBNET directly, you can manually upload files to SUBNET after logging in.

#. Generate the file(s) to upload from the command line with :mc:`mc support diagnostics` or :mc:`mc support inspect`
#. Sign in to `SUBNET <https://subnet.min.io>`_
#. Select :guilabel:`Deployments`
#. Select :guilabel:`Diagnostics`
#. Drag and drop the ``.gzip`` file(s) or browse to the file location to upload


Encrypting Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data from the Inspect tool in :ref:`Console <minio-console>` or the :mc:`mc support inspect` command can be encrypted.
For more details about encrypting or decrypting such files, see :ref:`Encrypting Files <minio-support-encryption>`.
