   ``mc ilm rule edit`` replaces ``mc ilm edit``.

Syntax
------

.. start-mc-ilm-rule-edit-desc

The :mc:`mc ilm rule edit` command modifies an existing object lifecycle management
rule on a MinIO bucket.

.. end-mc-ilm-rule-edit-desc

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: EXAMPLE

      The following command modifies existing lifecycle management rules for
      the ``mydata`` bucket on the ``myminio`` deployment:

      .. code-block:: shell
         :class: copyable

         mc ilm rule edit --id "c79ntj94b0t6rukh6lr0" --expiry-days 90  mydata/myminio
         
         mc ilm rule edit --id "c79nu2p4b0t6qko19rgg" --expired-object-delete-marker mydata/myminio

         mc ilm rule edit --id "c79n19dn10dnab109fg1" --transition-days 30 --tier "COLDTIER"
         
      The command modifies the specified rules as follows:

      - Delete objects more than 90 days old.
      - Delete ``DeleteMarker`` tombstones if that object has no other versions remaining.
      - Transition objects more than 30 days old to the ``COLDTIER`` remote tier.

   .. tab-item:: SYNTAX

      The command has the following syntax:

      .. code-block:: shell
         :class: copyable

         mc [GLOBALFLAGS] ilm rule edit                                       \
                          --id "string"                                       \
                          [--prefix "string"]                                 \
                          [--enable]                                          \
                          [--disable]                                         \

                          [--expire-delete-marker]                            \
                          [--transition-days "string"]                        \
                          [--transition-tier "string"]                        \
                          [--noncurrent-expire-days "string"]                 \

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

.. mc-cmd:: ALIAS
   :required:

   The :ref:`alias <alias>` and full path to the bucket on the MinIO
   deployment to which to modify the object lifecycle management rule. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: none

      mc ilm rule edit myminio/mydata

.. mc-cmd:: --id
   :required:

   The unique ID of the rule. Use :mc:`mc ilm rule ls` to list bucket
   rules and retrieve the ``id`` for the rule you want to modify.

.. mc-cmd:: --disable
   :optional:

   Stop using the rule, but retain the rule for future use.
   Objects do not transition or expire when a rule is disabled.

.. mc-cmd:: --enable
   :optional:

   Use a rule to transition or expire objects.

.. mc-cmd:: --prefix
   :optional:
   
   Restrict the management rule to a specific bucket prefix.
   
   For example:

   .. code-block:: none

      mc ilm rule edit --prefix "meetingnotes/" myminio/mydata/ --expire-days "90"

   The command modifies a rule that expires objects in the ``mydata`` bucket of the ``myminio`` ALIAS after 90 days for any object with the ``meetingnotes/`` prefix.

.. mc-cmd:: --expire-days
   :optional:

   The number of days to retain an object after being created. MinIO
   marks the object for deletion after the specified number of days pass.

   Exercise caution when using this option, as its behavior can result in
   immediate expiration of uploaded objects. Any objects created *after* 
   the specified expiration date are automatically eligible for expiration. 
   Similarly, specifying a calendar date that is *prior* to the current 
   system host datetime marks all objects covered by the rule for deletion. 
   Consider immediately removing any ILM rule using this option once the
   specified calendar date has passed.

   For versioned buckets, the expiry rule applies only to the *current*
   object version. Use the 
   :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --noncurrent-expire-days` option
   to apply expiration behavior to noncurrent object versions.

   MinIO uses a scanner process to check objects against all configured
   lifecycle management rules. Slow scanning due to high IO workloads or
   limited system resources may delay application of lifecycle management
   rules. See :ref:`minio-lifecycle-management-scanner` for more information.

   Mutually exclusive with the following options:

   - :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --expire-delete-marker`

.. mc-cmd:: --expire-delete-marker
   :optional:

   Specify this option to direct MinIO to remove delete markers for
   objects with no remaining object versions. Specifically, the delete marker is
   the *only* remaining "version" of the given object.

   This option is mutually exclusive with the following options:
   
   - :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --tags`
   - :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --expire-days`

   MinIO uses a scanner process to check objects against all configured
   lifecycle management rules. Slow scanning due to high IO workloads or
   limited system resources may delay application of lifecycle management
   rules. See :ref:`minio-lifecycle-management-scanner` for more information.

.. mc-cmd:: --noncurrent-expire-days
   :optional:

   The number of days to retain an object version after becoming
   *non-current* (i.e. a different version of that object is now the `HEAD`).
   MinIO marks noncurrent object versions for deletion after the specified
   number of days pass.

   This option has the same behavior as the 
   S3 ``NoncurrentVersionExpiration`` action.

   MinIO uses a scanner process to check objects against all configured
   lifecycle management rules. Slow scanning due to high IO workloads or
   limited system resources may delay application of lifecycle management
   rules. See :ref:`minio-lifecycle-management-scanner` for more information.

.. mc-cmd:: --noncurrent-expire-newer
   :optional:

   The number of non-current versions of an object to retain before applying expiration.
   Older non-current versions beyond the specified number expire.
   
   By default, MinIO does not retain any non-current versions when an expiration rule applies.

.. mc-cmd:: --noncurrent-transition-days
   :optional:

   The number of days an object has been non-current (i.e. replaced
   by a newer version of that same object) after which MinIO marks the object
   version as eligible for transition. MinIO transitions the object to the
   configured remote storage tier specified to the 
   :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --transition-tier` once the system host datetime
   passes that calendar date.

   This option has no effect on non-versioned buckets. Requires specifying
   :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --noncurrent-transition-tier`.

   This option has the same behavior as the 
   S3 ``NoncurrentVersionTransition`` action.

   MinIO uses a scanner process to check objects against all configured
   lifecycle management rules. Slow scanning due to high IO workloads or
   limited system resources may delay application of lifecycle management
   rules. See :ref:`minio-lifecycle-management-scanner` for more information.

.. mc-cmd:: --noncurrent-transition-newer
   :optional:

   The maximum number of non-current object versions to retain on the current tier.
   Older object versions beyond the number to retain transition to a different, specified tier.

   Use this flag to keep a certain number of non-current versions of an object accessible on the tier in a first in, first out order.

   If not specified, all non-current object versions transition to the different tier.

   The following table lists a number of object versions and their transition eligibility based on ``--noncurrent-transition-newer 3``:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 50 50
      :width: 100% 

      * - v5 (current version)
        - Current version not affected by ILM rules.
      * - v4
        - kept on current tier
      * - v3
        - kept on current tier
      * - v2
        - kept on current tier
      * - v1
        - marked for transition to other tier

   MinIO retains the current version, v5, on the tier.
   MinIO also retains the next ``3`` non-current versions on the tier, starting with the newest.
   This means MinIO leaves ``v4``, ``v3``, and ``v2`` for the three non-current version to keep on the current tier.

   ``v1`` would be a fourth non-current version, which falls outside the limit of non-current versions to retain, so MinIO marks ``v1`` for transition.

   Updating the number for this flag only impacts the unmarked versions of objects.
   Any versions already marked for transition do not change if you increase the number, and any object versions already transitioned do not transition back to the tier.

   MinIO uses a scanner process to check objects against all configured lifecycle management rules. 
   Slow scanning due to high IO workloads or limited system resources may delay application of lifecycle management rules. 
   See :ref:`minio-lifecycle-management-scanner` for more information.


.. mc-cmd:: --noncurrent-transition-tier
   :optional:

   The remote storage tier to which MinIO :ref:`transitions noncurrent objects versions <minio-lifecycle-management-tiering>`. 
   Specify a remote storage tier created by :mc:`mc ilm tier add`.

   MinIO does *not* automatically migrate objects from the previously
   specified remote tier to the new remote tier. MinIO continues to
   route requests for objects stored on the old remote tier.


.. mc-cmd:: --tags
   :optional:

   One or more ampersand ``&``-delimited key-value pairs describing
   the object tags to which to apply the lifecycle configuration rule.

   This option is mutually exclusive with the following option:

   - :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --expire-delete-marker`

.. mc-cmd:: --transition-days
   :optional:
   
   The number of calendar days from object creation after which MinIO
   marks an object as eligible for transition. MinIO transitions the object to
   the configured remote storage tier specified to the 
   :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --transition-tier`. 

   For versioned buckets, the transition rule applies only to the *current*
   object version. Use the 
   :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --noncurrent-transition-days` option
   to apply transition behavior to noncurrent object versions.

   Requires specifying :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --transition-tier`.

   MinIO uses a scanner process to check objects against all configured
   lifecycle management rules. Slow scanning due to high IO workloads or
   limited system resources may delay application of lifecycle management
   rules. See :ref:`minio-lifecycle-management-scanner` for more information.

.. mc-cmd:: --transition-tier
   :optional:

   The remote storage tier to which MinIO 
   :ref:`transition objects <minio-lifecycle-management-tiering>`. Specify a
   remote storage tier created by :mc:`mc ilm tier add`. 

   Required if specifying :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --transition-days`.

   MinIO does *not* automatically migrate objects from the previously
   specified remote tier to the new remote tier. MinIO continues to
   route requests for objects stored on the old remote tier.

Examples
--------

Modify an Existing Lifecycle Management Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use :mc:`mc ilm rule edit` with :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --id` to modify
an existing object expiration rule:

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   mc ilm rule edit ALIAS/PATH --id "RULEID" [FLAGS]

- Replace :mc-cmd:`ALIAS <mc ilm rule edit ALIAS>` with the 
  :mc:`alias <mc alias>` of the S3-compatible host.

- Replace :mc-cmd:`PATH <mc ilm rule edit ALIAS>` with the path to the bucket on the
  S3-compatible host.

- Replace ``RULEID`` with the unique ID of the object lifecycle management rule.
  Use :mc:`mc ilm rule ls` to find the ``RULEID``.

- Specify any additional flags to add or modify the lifecycle management
  rule. For example, specify
  :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --transition-days` to override the existing 
  transition days value for the rule.

Disable a Lifecycle Management Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use :mc:`mc ilm rule edit` with :mc-cmd:`~mc ilm rule edit --disable` to stop using an existing management rule.

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable
   
   mc ilm rule edit --id "RULEID" --disable myminio/mybucket

- Replace ``RULEID`` with the unique ID of the object lifecycle management rule.
  Use :mc:`mc ilm rule ls` to find the ``RULEID``.
- Replace ``myminio`` with the ALIAS of the deployment where the rule exists.
- Replace ``mybucket`` with the bucket for the rule.
