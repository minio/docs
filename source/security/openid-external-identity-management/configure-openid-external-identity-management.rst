Overview
--------

MinIO supports using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible IDentity Provider (IDP)
such as Okta, KeyCloak, Dex, Google, or Facebook for external management of user
identities. The procedure on this page provides instructions for:

- Configuring a MinIO cluster for an external OIDC provider.
- Logging into the cluster using the MinIO Console and OIDC credentials.
- Using the MinIO ``AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`` Security Token Service (STS)
  API to generate temporary credentials for use by applications.

This procedure is generic for OIDC compatible providers. Defer to
the documentation for the OIDC provider of your choice for specific instructions
or procedures on authentication and JWT retrieval.

Prerequisites
-------------

OpenID-Connect (OIDC) Compatible IDentity Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure assumes an existing OIDC provider such as Okta,
KeyCloak, Dex, Google, or Facebook. Instructions on configuring these services
are out of scope for this procedure.

Ensure each user identity intended for use with MinIO has the appropriate
:ref:`claim <minio-external-identity-management-openid-access-control>` configured such that
MinIO can associate a :ref:`policy <minio-policy>` to the authenticated user.
An OpenID user with no assigned policy has no permission to access any action
or resource on the MinIO cluster.

MinIO Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure assumes an existing MinIO cluster running the 
:minio-git:`latest stable MinIO version <minio/releases/latest>`. 
This procedure *may* work as expected for older versions of MinIO.

Install and Configure ``mc`` with Access to the MinIO Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure uses :mc:`mc` for performing operations on the
MinIO cluster. Install ``mc`` on a machine with network access to the cluster.
See the ``mc`` :ref:`Installation Quickstart <mc-install>` for instructions on
downloading and installing ``mc``.

This procedure assumes a configured :mc:`alias <mc alias>` for the MinIO
cluster.

Procedure
---------

1) Set the OpenID Configuration Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the :abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider using either
environment variables *or* server runtime configuration settings. Both
methods require starting/restarting the MinIO deployment to apply changes. The
following tabs provide a quick reference of all required and optional
environment variables and configuration settings respectively:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Environment Variables

      MinIO supports specifying the :abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider
      settings using :ref:`environment variables
      <minio-server-envvar-external-identity-management-openid>`. The 
      :mc:`minio server` process applies the specified settings on its next
      startup. For distributed deployments, specify these settings across all
      nodes in the deployment using the *same* values consistently.

      The following example code sets *all* environment variables related to
      configuring an :abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider for external
      identity management. The minimum *required* variable is 
      :envvar:`MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CONFIG_URL`:

      .. code-block:: shell
         :class: copyable

         set MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CONFIG_URL="https://openid-provider.example.net/.well-known/openid-configuration"
         set MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CLIENT_ID="<string>"
         set MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CLAIM_NAME="<string>"
         set MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CLAIM_PREFIX="<string>"
         set MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_SCOPES="<string>"
         set MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_COMMENT="<string>"

      Replace the ``MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CONFIG_URL`` with the URL endpoint of
      the :abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider discovery document. 

      For complete documentation on these variables, see
      :ref:`minio-server-envvar-external-identity-management-openid`

   .. tab:: Configuration Settings

      MinIO supports specifying the :abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider
      settings using :mc-conf:`configuration settings <identity_openid>`. The 
      :mc:`minio server` process applies the specified settings on its next
      startup. For distributed deployments, the :mc-cmd:`mc admin config`
      command applies the configuration to all nodes in the deployment.

      The following example code sets *all* configuration settings related to
      configuring an :abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider for external
      identity management. The minimum *required* setting is 
      :mc-conf:`identity_openid config_url <identity_openid.config_url>`:

      .. code-block:: shell
         :class: copyable

         mc admin config set ALIAS/ identity_openid \
            config_url="https://openid-provider.example.net/.well-known/openid-configuration" \
            client_id="<string>" \
            claim_name="<string>" \
            claim_prefix="<string>" \
            scopes="<string>" \
            comment="<string>"

      Replace the ``config_url`` with the URL endpoint of the 
      :abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider discovery document. 

      For more complete documentation on these settings, see
      :mc-conf:`identity_openid`.

2) Restart the MinIO Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must restart the MinIO deployment to apply the configuration changes. 
Use the :mc-cmd:`mc admin service restart` command to restart the deployment.

.. important::

   MinIO restarts *all* :mc:`minio server` processes associated to the 
   deployment at the same time. Applications may experience a brief period of 
   downtime during the restart process. 

   Consider scheduling the restart during a maintenance period to minimize
   interruption of services.

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   mc admin service restart ALIAS

Replace ``ALIAS`` with the :mc:`alias <mc-alias>` of the deployment to 
restart.

3) Use the MinIO Console to Log In with OIDC Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MinIO Console supports the full workflow of authenticating to the
:abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider, generating temporary credentials using
the MinIO :ref:`minio-sts-assumerolewithwebidentity` Security Token Service
(STS) endpoint, and logging the user into the MinIO deployment.

Starting in RELEASE, the MinIO Console is embedded in the MinIO server.
You can access the Console by opening the root URL for the MinIO cluster.
For example, ``https://minio.example.net:9001``.

From the Console, click :guilabel:`BUTTON` to begin the OpenID authentication
flow.

Once logged in, you can perform any action for which the authenticated
user is :ref:`authorized 
<minio-external-identity-management-openid-access-control>`. 

You can also create :ref:`service accounts <minio-idp-service-account>` for
supporting applications which must perform operations on MinIO. Service accounts
are long-lived credentials which inherit their privileges from the parent user.
The parent user can further restrict those privileges while creating the service
account. 

4) Generate S3-Compatible Temporary Credentials using OIDC Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MinIO requires clients authenticate using :s3-api:`AWS Signature Version 4
protocol <sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>` with support for the deprecated
Signature Version 2 protocol. Specifically, clients must present a valid access
key and secret key to access any S3 or MinIO administrative API, such as
``PUT``, ``GET``, and ``DELETE`` operations.

Applications can generate temporary access credentials as-needed using the 
:ref:`minio-sts-assumerolewithwebidentity` Security Token Service (STS)
API endpoint and the JSON Web Token (JWT) returned by the 
:abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider.

The application must provide a workflow for logging into the 
:abbr:`OIDC (OpenID Connect)` provider and retrieving the 
JSON Web Token (JWT) associated to the authentication session. Defer to the
provider documentation for obtaining and parsing the JWT token after successful
authentication. MinIO provides an example Go application 
:minio-git:`web-identity.go <minio/blob/master/docs/sts/web-identity.go>` with
an example of managing this workflow.

Once the application retrieves the JWT token, use the 
``AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`` endpoint to generate the temporary credentials:

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   POST https://minio.example.net/Action=AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
   &WebIdentityToken=TOKEN
   &Version=2011-06-15
   &DurationSeconds=86400
   &Policy=Policy

- Replace the ``TOKEN`` with the JWT token returned in the previous step.
- Replace the ``DurationSeconds`` with the duration in seconds until the
  temporary credentials expire. The example above specifies a period of 
  ``86400`` seconds, or 24 hours.
- Replace the ``Policy`` with an inline URL-encoded JSON 
  :ref:`policy <minio-policy>` that further restricts the permissions associated
  to the temporary credentials. Omit to use the policy associated to the
  OpenID user :ref:`policy claim <minio-external-identity-management-openid-access-control>`.

The API response consists of an XML document containing the
access key, secret key, session token, and expiration date. Applications
can use the access key and secret key to access and perform operations on
MinIO.
